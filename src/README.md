# File structure

* `Examples.agda` Examples of how to use the macro
* `CongruenceMacro.agda` The main file with the definition of the macro and parsing of context and goal.
* `CongruenceClosure.agda` The core calculation of the congruence closure procedure.
* `ReflectionUtils.agda` Tooling for Reflection in Agda, extracting path information and constructing terms.
* `List.agda` and `Map.agda` are _temporary_ files with standard functions, which hopefully will disappear soon.
